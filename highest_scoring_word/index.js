/* Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid. */

//! Solution :

function high(x) {
  const words = x.split(" ");
  let maxScore = 0;
  let highestWord = "";

  for (let word of words) {
    let score = 0;

    for (let char of word) {
      score += char.charCodeAt(0) - 96;

      if (score > maxScore) {
        maxScore = score;
        highestWord = word;
      }
    }
  }

  return highestWord;
}

const result = high("man i need a taxi up to ubud");
console.log("highest Word = ",result)
